# OpenXLSX
OpenXLSX is a C++ library for reading, writing, creating and modifying Microsoft ExcelÂ® files, with the .xlsx format.

## New in version 0.2.0
The internal architecture of OpenXLSX has been significantly re-designed since the previous version. The reason is that the library was turning into a big ball of mud, and it was increasingly difficult to add features and fix bugs. With the new architecture, it will (hopefully) be easier to manage and to add new features.

Due to the re-design of the architecture, there are a few changes to the public interface. These changes, however, are not significant, and it should be easy to update:

* All internal objects are now handled as values rather than pointers, similar to the approach taken in the underlying PugiXML library. This means that when requesting a certain worksheet from a workbook, the resulting worksheet is not returned as a pointer, but as an object that supports both copying and moving.
* The distingction between interface objects and implementation objects are now gone, as it made it very difficult to manage changes. It was an attempt to implement the pimpl idiom, but it wasn't very effective. In the future, I may try to implement pimpl again, but only if it can be done in a simpler way.
* All member functions have been renamed to begin wtih a small letter (camelCase), i.e. the member function WorksheetCount() is renamed to worksheetCount(). This was done mostly for cosmetic reasons.

I realise that these changes may cause problems for some users. Because of that, the previous version of OpenXLSX can be found in the "legacy" branch of this repository. However, I strongly recommend that you transition to the new version instead.

## Motivation
Many programming languages have the ability to modify Excel files, either natively or in the form of open source libraries. This includes Python, Java and C#. For C++, however, things are more scattered. While there are some libraries, they are generally less mature and have a smaller feature set than for other languages. 

Because there are no open source library that fully fitted my needs, I decided to develop the OpenXLSX library.

Here is a summary of the main C++ libraries for Excel files that I'm aware of:

### libxls
The libxls library (https://sourceforge.net/projects/libxls/) is a C library for reading files in the legacy Excel file format, .xls. It cannot be used for writing or modifying Excel files.

### xlslib
The xlslib library (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xlslib/) is a C/C++ library for creating files in the legacy Excel file format, .xls. It cannot be used for reading or modifying Excel files.

### libxlsxwriter
The libxlsxwriter library (https://libxlsxwriter.github.io) is a C library for creating .xlsx files. It cannot be used for reading or modifying Excel files.

### LibXL
The LibXL library (http://www.libxl.com) can read, write, create and modify Excel files, in both the .xls and .xlsx formats. It is the most feature complete library available and has interfaces for C, C++, C# and Delphi. It is only available for purchase, however.

### QtXlsx
Of the open source libraries, the QtXlsx library (https://github.com/dbzhang800/QtXlsxWriter) is the most feature complete. It is, however, based on the Qt framework. While I'm a big fan of Qt for application programming purposes, I don't believe it is the best option for lower-level libraries.

### XLNT
Recently, I found the XLNT library on GitHub (https://github.com/tfussell/xlnt). It was not available when I began developing OpenXLSX. To be honest, if it had, I wouldn't have begun OpenXLSX. It has a larger feature set and probably has fewer bugs. However, I decided to continue developing OpenXLSX, because I believe that in a few areas it is better than XLNT. Primarily, OpenXLSX is better able to handle very large spreadsheets (up to a million rows). 

## Ambition
The ambition is that OpenXLSX should be able to read, write, create and modify Excel files (data as well as formatting), and do so with as few dependencies as possible. Currently, OpenXLSX depends on the following 3rd party libraries:

 - PugiXML
 - Zippy (C++ wrapper around miniz)

these libraries are included in the repository, i.e. it's not necessary to download and build separately.

## Compatibility
  OpenXLSX can be built and run on the following platforms/compilers:

| Platform\Compiler | GCC | Clang | MSVC |
|:------------------|:----|:------|:-----|
| Windows           |     |       |      |
| MacOS             |     |       |      |
| Linux             |     |       |      |


  - Linux (GCC/Clang)
  - MacOS (GCC/Clang/Xcode)
  - Windows (MinGW/Clang/MSVC)

  Building on Windows using MSYS or Cygwin has not been tested.
  Building using the Intel compiler has not been tested.

## Current Status
 OpenXLSX is still work i progress. The following is a list of features which have been implemented and should be working properly:

  - Create/open/save files
  - Read/write/modify cell contents
  - Copy cells and cell ranges
  - Copy worksheets
  - Ranges and Iterators

  Features related to formatting, plots and figures have not been implemented, and are not planned to be in the near future.

  It should be noted, that creating const XLDocument objects, is currently not working!

### Performance


## Caveats

### File Size
An .xlsx file is essentially a bunch of .xml files in a .zip archive. Internally, OpenXLSX uses the miniz library to compress/decompress the .zip archive, and it turns out that miniz has an upper limit regarding the file sizes it can handle.

The maximum allowable file size for a file in an archive (i.e. en entry in a .zip archive, not the archive itself) is 4 GB (uncompressed). Usually, the largest file in an .xlsx file/archive, will be the .xml files holding the worksheet data. I.e., the worksheet data may not exceed 4 GB. What that translates to in terms of rows and columns depend a lot on the type of data, but 1,048,576 rows x 128 columns filled with 4-digit integers will take up approx. 4 GB. The size of the compressed archive also depends on the data held in the worksheet, as well as the compression algorithm used, but a workbook with a single worksheet of 4 GB will usually have a compressed size of 300-350 MB.

The 4 GB limitation is only related to a single entry in an archive, not the total archive size. That means that if an archive holds multiple entries with a size of 4GB, miniz can still handle it. For OpenXLSX, this means that a workbook with several large worksheets can still be opened.

### Memory Usage
OpenXLSX uses the PugiXML library for parsing and manipulating .xml files in .xlsx archive. PugiXML is a DOM parser, which reads the entire .xml document into memory. That makes parsing and manipulation incredibly fast.

However, all choices have consequences, and using a DOM parser can also demand a lot of memory. For small spreadsheets, it shouldn't be a problem, but if you need to manipulate large spreadsheets, you may need a lot of memory.

The table below gives an indication of how many columns of data can be handled by OpenXLSX (assuming 1,048,576 rows):

|           | Columns |
|:----------|:--------|
| 8 GB RAM  | 8-16    |
| 16 GB RAM | 32-64   |
| 32 GB RAM | 128-256 |

Your milage may vary. The performance of OpenXLSX will depend on the type of data in the spreadsheet.

Note also that it is recommended to use OpenXLSX in 64-bit mode. While it can easily be used in 32-bit mode, it can only access 4 GB of RAM, which will severely limit the usefulness when handling large spreadsheets.

If memory consumption is an issue for you, you can build the OpenXLSX library in compact mode (look for the ENABLE_COMPACT_MODE in the CMakeLists.txt file), which will enable PugiXML's compact mode. OpenXLSX will then use less memory, but also run slower. See further details in the PugiXML documentation [here](https://pugixml.org/docs/manual.html#dom.memory.compact). A test case run on Linux VM with 8 GB RAM revealed that OpenXLSX could handle a worksheet with 1,048,576 rows x 32 columns in compact mode, versus 1,048,576 rows x 16 columns in default mode.

### Unicode
  All string manipulations and usage in OpenXLSX uses the C++ std::string, which is encoding agnostic, but can easily be used for UTF-8 encoding. Also, Excel uses UTF-8 encoding internally (actually, it might be possible to use other encodings, but I'm not sure about that).
  
  For the above reason, **if you work with other text encodings, you have to convert to/from UTF-8 yourself**. There are a number of options (e.g. Boost.Nowide or Boost.Text). I will also suggest that you watch James McNellis' presentation at [CppCon 2014](https://youtu.be/n0GK-9f4dl8), and read [Joel Spolsky's blog](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/).

  Note also that while UTF-8 is well supported on Linux and MacOS, support on Windows is more limited. For example, output of non-ASCII characters (e.g. Chinese or Japanese characters) to the terminal window will look like gibberish.

                return "integer";
        }
    };

    cout << "Cell A1: (" << valueTypeAsString(A1.valueType()) << ") " << A1.get<double>() << endl;
    cout << "Cell B1: (" << valueTypeAsString(B1.valueType()) << ") " << B1.get<int>() << endl;
    cout << "Cell C1: (" << valueTypeAsString(C1.valueType()) << ") " << C1.get<std::string>() << endl;
    cout << "Cell D1: (" << valueTypeAsString(D1.valueType()) << ") " << D1.get<bool>() << endl;
    cout << "Cell E1: (" << valueTypeAsString(E1.valueType()) << ") " << E1.get<std::string_view>() << endl;

    doc.save();

    return 0;
}
