TBD: how can I invoke XMLDocument* getXmlDocument()? I was forced to to a const_cast because the compiler insisted on
  using the const version for the assignment to a non-const XMLDocument pointer

2024-07-08:
X complete support for a GNU Makefile (Makefile.GNU and make-gnu.sh)

X implemented upstream bugfix https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/pull/621 into pugixml
affects:
  OpenXLSX/external/pugixml/pugixml.cpp

X enforce explicit saving declaration for XMLDocument entries
  This change obsoletes a modification to pugixml xml_document::save, where the default encoding UTF-8 was explicitly saved.
  The same is now accomplished through use of a saving declaration, without a modification to pugixml from the official repository version
affects:
  OpenXLSX/sources/XLXmlData.cpp std::string XLXmlData::getRawData() const
  external/pugixml/pugixml.cpp xml_document::save
